    "THe idea can be expanded to three points and three weighting factors crating a subset in R2. Frmm there any number points creating a subset in R2, and this can also be extended to R3, and further to Rn. Although the visualization becomes more difficult. Note these are subset and not subspaces of the Rn's. \n",

    "Another way to think about it is that with weight factors only in the range from 0 to 1 inclusive it is not possible to leave the range of points because you cannot subtract and you cannot more than 1.0 times any given point which would just be that point and the edge of the subset. "
