    "The missing piece is dividing the od-table by 1/(n!\\*h^n), where n is the degree of the difference column. This accounts for the division in the divided difference table for each divided difference value. The first column is divided by h (the equal spacing of x-values). The second column is divide by (h\\*2h), this accounts for the division of h of the first column and the division of 2h, e.g. 1/(x2-x0), of the second column. The third column is divided by (h\\*2h\\*3h), this accounts for division of h of the first column, 2h for the second column, 3h, e.g. 1/(x3-x0), for the third column. This pattern can be expressed by dividing by (n!\\*h^n) for any degree of difference n. \n",
