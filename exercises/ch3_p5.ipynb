As the problem states, an extrapolation instead of an interpolation. However, exp() is a continuous, well-behaved function so a polynomial with a few points can probably reasonably approximate it. Additionally, the extrapolated point is relatively close to the points used for the approximation. \n",

    "A little less fiddling this time. Wrote an equation to calc the upper and lower bounds which I think helped make the calculations more clear. Still had to correct the error calculation to be actual minus approximate, it was carried over from the first iteration of p4. I thought I might add the poly_error function to the incf module but honestly how often will we know the equation for practical applications of these methods? Never. If we know the equation we would just evaluate the equation, not try to approximate it with a polynomial. This is purely an academic exercise to see how well a polynomial approximation can work at least for a well-behaved function. "
